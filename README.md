# S21-Smart-home-spying
Final project for UVa Spring21 CS6501 Network Security and Privacy

This project demonstrates various ways to infer device identities as well as user activities using smart home traffic. Second, it includes the implementation of an efficient visualization tool for device identification using DNS queries. Third, two case studies are analyzed to demonstrate how much information can be inferred for the selected smart home devices (Google Nest Mini and Sengled Light Bulb).

1. *device_dns_wordCloud* folder contains jupyter notebook file for generating DNS queries domain name wordcloud from DNS queries. 
 The data used for this work can be downloaded at [IoTFinder Data](https://yourthings.info/data/)
 
2. *case study* folder contains
    - two traffic data collected at home with Google Nest Mini and Sengled light bulb
    - Code for analysis correlation between device activities and traffic rate
